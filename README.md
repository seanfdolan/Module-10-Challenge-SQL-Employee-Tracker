# Module 10 Challenge: SQL Employee Tracker

## Description
The motivation for this command-line application was to make managing a company's database easier, by using Node.js, Inquirer, PostgreSQL, and DataGrip.
To begin the application, the user must run: 
```
node index.js
```

## Installation
***Requirements to Install***

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) | [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) | [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

***Once Installed:***
1. Clone the Repository on to your machine.
2. Open the terminal and ensure you are in the right file path.
3. Run the command ```npm install``` to download the packages.
4. Then run the command ```node index.js``` to run the software.
5. The command prompt will begin on your terminal.

## Usage
When the Employee Tracker is integrated with the user terminal run 'node index.js'. This will initiate the software.

## Installation
Knowledge and installation of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL are required for the software to operate from the command-line.

## Credits
The Colombia U/edX lessons were followed particularly number 23, Parameterized Queries, as well as the Mini-Project. The employee-tracker by jgarcia45 on github was a tremendous help.
